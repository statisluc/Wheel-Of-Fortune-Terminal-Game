A simple Python project I made in my freshman year of computer science.
By running the code within a python environment, the player can advance through the game using the on-screen commands. There are a number of words and phrases to guess, each with their own hint. Have fun, hope you enjoy

(Due to copyright restrictions on parts of the assignment, I cannot upload the complete game. However, this is the logic, and screenshots + screen recordings are attached on my portfolio website)
